# Research: Simple GitHub Flow Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Feature**: 004-simple-github-flow

## Research Questions & Decisions

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration for Automatic Testing

**Decision**: Minimal GitHub Actions with optional test running
**Rationale**: Solo developer needs fast feedback without mandatory test gates that slow deployment
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full CI/CD with mandatory tests: Too slow for rapid iteration
- No CI/CD: Loses automatic deployment benefits
- Hybrid approach (chosen): Tests run but don't block deployment, results shown as status checks

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Tests run in parallel, don't block deployment
# Developer sees test status but can deploy regardless
continue-on-error: true
```

### 2. Branch Protection Rules Level

**Decision**: No branch protection for main branch
**Rationale**: Solo developer needs ability to quickly fix issues without PR overhead
**Alternatives considered**:
- Require PR reviews: Impossible for solo developer
- Require status checks: Slows down hotfixes
- No protection (chosen): Trust developer judgment, rely on easy rollback

**Implementation**:
- Keep main branch unprotected
- Use tags for stable release points
- Document rollback procedure prominently

### 3. Environment Variable Management

**Decision**: Vercel dashboard for production, .env.local for development
**Rationale**: Clear separation, no secrets in repository
**Alternatives considered**:
- GitHub Secrets + injection: Complex for beginners
- Encrypted .env files: Key management overhead
- Vercel dashboard (chosen): Visual interface, easy to update

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Development
cp .env.example .env.local
# Production: Set in Vercel dashboard UI
```

### 4. Git Alias and Helper Patterns

**Decision**: Shell aliases + helper script with memorable names
**Rationale**: Beginners remember words better than flags
**Alternatives considered**:
- Git aliases only: Limited functionality
- Complex Git hooks: Hard to debug
- Shell script + aliases (chosen): Full power, easy to understand

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Aliases
alias gs="git status"
alias gp="git push origin main"
alias gf="git-flow"  # Helper script

# Helper script commands
git-flow deploy     # Full deployment flow
git-flow hotfix     # Quick fix flow
git-flow feature    # New feature flow
```

## Best Practices Identified

### GitHub Actions for Solo Developers
1. **Fast feedback over comprehensive checks**
   - Run tests in parallel with deployment
   - Show results but don't block

2. **Simple workflow files**
   - One file per trigger (push to main, PR opened)
   - Clear naming and comments

3. **Cost optimization**
   - Use workflow_dispatch for expensive operations
   - Cache dependencies aggressively

### Vercel Deployment Patterns
1. **Automatic deployments**
   - Main branch → Production
   - PR → Preview with unique URL
   - Comments on PR with preview link

2. **Rollback strategy**
   - Instant rollback via Vercel dashboard
   - Git revert as backup method
   - Tag stable versions for reference

3. **Environment management**
   - Development: .env.local (gitignored)
   - Staging: PR preview environments
   - Production: Vercel dashboard variables

### Git Workflow for Beginners
1. **Minimal commands**
   - 80% of work uses 5 commands
   - Aliases for common operations
   - Helper script for complex flows

2. **Clear mental model**
   - main = production (always deployable)
   - feature/* = work in progress
   - No other branch types needed

3. **Safety nets**
   - Frequent commits (can always revert)
   - Tags for milestones
   - Vercel deployment history

## Technical Specifications

### Required Tools
- Git 2.25+ (for recent features)
- GitHub CLI 2.0+ (for PR operations)
- Bash 4+ (for helper scripts)
- Node.js 18+ (for Vercel CLI)

### File Structure
```
.github/
  workflows/
    deploy.yml      # Main branch deployment
    preview.yml     # PR preview deployment
scripts/
  git-flow-helper.sh   # Main helper script
  setup-git-flow.sh    # Initial setup
  lib/
    git-helpers.sh     # Shared functions
.env.example           # Template for local development
```

### Integration Points
1. **Git → GitHub**
   - Push triggers workflows
   - PR creation triggers previews
   - Tags trigger releases (optional)

2. **GitHub → Vercel**
   - Webhook on push to main
   - Webhook on PR events
   - Status checks reported back

3. **Local → Remote**
   - Helper script manages flow
   - Aliases reduce typing
   - Clear error messages

## Resolved Clarifications

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been resolved:

1. **CI/CD Testing**: Tests run but don't block deployment
2. **Branch Protection**: None for solo developer
3. **Environment Variables**: Vercel dashboard for production

## Next Steps

With research complete, Phase 1 can proceed to create:
- data-model.md (workflow states and configurations)
- contracts/ (command interfaces and workflow definitions)
- quickstart.md (getting started guide)
- Test files (workflow validation tests)
