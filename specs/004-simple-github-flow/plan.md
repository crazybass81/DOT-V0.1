# Implementation Plan: Simple GitHub Flow

**Branch**: `004-simple-github-flow` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-simple-github-flow/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement a Simple GitHub Flow branching strategy for DOT Platform to enable solo developers to deploy frequently with minimal complexity. The system will use main branch as the primary production branch with automatic deployment to Vercel, feature branches for larger changes with PR previews, and simplified Git workflows for beginners.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Bash scripting, GitHub Actions YAML
**Primary Dependencies**: Git, GitHub CLI (gh), Vercel CLI
**Storage**: Git repository (GitHub), Vercel deployment history
**Testing**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
**Target Platform**: GitHub repository with Vercel deployment
**Project Type**: single - DevOps/workflow configuration
**Performance Goals**: Deploy within 5 minutes of push
**Constraints**: Single developer workflow, beginner-friendly commands
**Scale/Scope**: 1 developer, multiple deployments per day

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (workflow configuration)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Git, GitHub, Vercel native)
- Single data model? N/A (no data model needed)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (no complex Git patterns)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (workflow configuration)
- Libraries listed: git-flow-helper (Git workflow automation)
- CLI per library: git-flow --help, git-flow --init, git-flow --deploy
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? Yes

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (workflow tests first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (real Git, real Vercel)
- Integration tests for: GitHub Actions, Vercel deployments
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (deployment logs)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes (Git/deployment errors)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A (new feature)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - DevOps/workflow tooling

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration for automatic testing
   - Branch protection rules level of enforcement
   - Environment variable management between local and production

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research GitHub Actions CI/CD best practices for solo developers"
   Task: "Find optimal branch protection rules for single developer workflow"
   Task: "Research Vercel environment variable management patterns"
   Task: "Investigate Git alias and helper script patterns for beginners"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Branch configurations
   - Deployment configurations
   - Workflow states

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Git workflow commands interface
   - GitHub Actions workflow specs
   - Vercel deployment configurations

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test Git workflow commands
   - Test GitHub Actions triggers
   - Test Vercel deployment hooks

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Small bug fix → direct main push → auto deploy
   - New feature → feature branch → PR → preview → merge
   - Rollback scenario → revert to previous deployment

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add Simple GitHub Flow context
   - Update recent changes

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md update

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Git workflow setup tasks [P]
- GitHub Actions configuration tasks [P]
- Vercel integration tasks
- Helper script implementation tasks
- Documentation and quickstart tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Git setup → GitHub config → Vercel integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, workflow validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations - simple, single-project workflow configuration following all constitutional principles.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)

**Gate Status**:
