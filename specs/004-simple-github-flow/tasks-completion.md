# Tasks: Simple GitHub Flow - Completion Phase

**Input**: Implementation from `/specs/004-simple-github-flow/`
**Prerequisites**: Core implementation complete (T001-T023)
**Branch**: `004-simple-github-flow`

## Execution Flow (completion)
```
1. Validate all implementations work correctly
2. Update project documentation
3. Run comprehensive tests
4. Ensure production readiness
5. Final polish and cleanup
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 4: Validation & Testing

### Integration Testing
- [ ] T024 Run full workflow validation tests
  - Execute: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/tests/integration/git-flow.test.sh`
  - Execute: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/tests/integration/github-actions.test.sh`
  - Execute: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/tests/integration/deployment.test.sh`
  - Execute: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/tests/unit/helpers.test.sh`
  - Verify all tests pass after implementation

- [ ] T025 [P] Test git-flow commands in actual repository
  - Test: `git-flow status` command output
  - Test: `git-flow feature test-feature` creates correct branch
  - Test: `git-flow hotfix test-fix` workflow
  - Verify: Commands work without errors

- [ ] T026 [P] Validate GitHub Actions syntax
  - Run: `yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml` or manual validation
  - Check: Workflow triggers are correct
  - Verify: Environment variables properly referenced

## Phase 5: Documentation Updates

- [ ] T027 Update CLAUDE.md with Simple GitHub Flow context
  - Edit: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/CLAUDE.md`
  - Add section: "## Git Workflow Commands"
  - Document: Available git-flow commands
  - Include: Quick reference for developers

- [ ] T028 [P] Complete .env.example with all variables
  - Edit: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/.env.example`
  - Add: Vercel deployment variables
  - Add: GitHub Actions secrets needed
  - Include: Comments explaining each variable

- [ ] T029 [P] Create data-model.md for workflow states
  - Create: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/specs/004-simple-github-flow/data-model.md`
  - Document: Branch states (main, feature/*, hotfix/*)
  - Document: Deployment states (deployed, rolled-back)
  - Document: Tag naming conventions

- [ ] T030 [P] Create contracts directory with command interfaces
  - Create: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/specs/004-simple-github-flow/contracts/`
  - Create: `contracts/git-flow-commands.md` - CLI command contracts
  - Create: `contracts/github-actions.md` - Workflow contracts
  - Document: Input/output for each command

## Phase 6: Production Readiness

- [ ] T031 Add error recovery to git-flow-helper.sh
  - Edit: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/scripts/git-flow-helper.sh`
  - Add: Stash uncommitted changes before operations
  - Add: Recovery from failed merges
  - Add: Network error handling

- [ ] T032 [P] Add logging to track deployments
  - Create: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/scripts/lib/logging.sh`
  - Log: Each deployment with timestamp
  - Log: Rollback operations
  - Store: Logs in `.git-flow/logs/` directory

- [ ] T033 Create deployment validation script
  - Create: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/scripts/validate-deployment.sh`
  - Check: GitHub Actions status
  - Check: Vercel deployment status
  - Report: Success/failure with details

## Phase 7: Final Polish

- [ ] T034 [P] Add Korean language support to scripts
  - Edit: Helper scripts to include Korean messages
  - Add: `LANG` environment variable detection
  - Provide: Bilingual error messages

- [ ] T035 [P] Create troubleshooting guide
  - Create: `/home/ec2-user/DOT-V0.1/docs/git-flow-troubleshooting.md`
  - Document: Common errors and solutions
  - Include: Recovery procedures
  - Add: FAQ section

- [ ] T036 Run performance tests
  - Measure: Script execution time
  - Test: Large repository handling
  - Optimize: Slow operations if found

- [ ] T037 Final cleanup and optimization
  - Remove: Debugging echo statements
  - Optimize: Redundant code
  - Ensure: Consistent coding style

## Dependencies
- T024 must complete before T025-T026 (validate basics first)
- T027-T030 can run in parallel (different files)
- T031-T033 enhance existing implementation
- T034-T037 are final polish tasks

## Parallel Execution Example
```bash
# Launch documentation tasks together (T027-T030):
Task: "Update CLAUDE.md with Git Flow context"
Task: "Complete .env.example with all variables"
Task: "Create data-model.md for workflow states"
Task: "Create contracts directory with command interfaces"

# Launch polish tasks together (T034-T035):
Task: "Add Korean language support to scripts"
Task: "Create troubleshooting guide"
```

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass (T024)
- [ ] Commands work in real repository (T025)
- [ ] GitHub Actions valid (T026)
- [ ] Documentation complete (T027-T030)
- [ ] Error handling robust (T031)
- [ ] Deployment trackable (T032-T033)
- [ ] Bilingual support (T034)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (T036)

## Success Criteria
1. **Developer can deploy in < 1 minute**
2. **Rollback works reliably**
3. **Clear error messages in Korean/English**
4. **All tests passing**
5. **Documentation comprehensive**

## Next Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)
