# Implementation Plan: DOT Platform Deployment Validation

**Branch**: `003-deployment-validation` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [specs/003-/spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → SUCCESS: Loaded deployment validation requirements
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detected Project Type: web (frontend + backend)
   → Set Structure Decision: Option 2 (Web application)
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → No violations: Deployment validation uses existing infrastructure
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check ✓
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research deployment tools, validation strategies, testing approaches
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → Generate health check contracts, validation data model, deployment guide
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → No new violations expected
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check ✓
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
배포 후 파일 수정 없이 DOT Platform의 구현된 기능을 실제 환경에서 검증할 수 있는 시스템을 구축. Docker Compose 기반 배포, 자동 헬스체크, 핵심 기능 검증 스크립트, 성능 모니터링을 포함한 포괄적인 배포 검증 파이프라인을 제공.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js 18+, React 18, PostgreSQL 14, Redis 7
**Primary Dependencies**: Docker Compose, Nginx, Express.js, React Router, Prisma ORM
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (session/cache), File system (uploads)
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Jest (unit), Supertest (integration)
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Docker containers)
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: <3초 페이지 로딩, 10명 동시 사용자 지원, 99% 업타임
**Constraints**: 파일 수정 금지, 실제 배포 환경에서만 검증, 기존 코드 무결성 유지
**Scale/Scope**: 중소 레스토랑 (직원 10-50명), 일일 출퇴근 체크인 100-500회

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (deployment validation scripts, health monitoring) (max 3 ✓)
- Using framework directly? YES (Docker Compose, Nginx, existing test frameworks)
- Single data model? YES (validation results, system metrics)
- Avoiding patterns? YES (no Repository/UoW - direct API calls for validation)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? NO - validation scripts are operational tools, not application features
- Libraries listed: N/A - deployment validation is infrastructure/operations
- CLI per library: YES - validation commands with --help/--version/--format
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? YES for validation tools

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES (validation tests fail → fix deployment → pass)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES (validation scripts before deployment)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES (health endpoints → API validation → UI testing → component tests)
- Real dependencies used? YES (actual PostgreSQL, Redis, production-like environment)
- Integration tests for: deployment process, service health, API contracts, UI functionality
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES (deployment logs, validation results, error tracking)
- Frontend logs → backend? YES (existing Sentry integration)
- Error context sufficient? YES (deployment status, validation metrics, failure details)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? YES (current DOT Platform version + validation suite version)
- BUILD increments on every change? YES (validation script updates)
- Breaking changes handled? N/A (no code changes allowed, only validation additions)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Existing frontend + backend structure with additional deployment validation layer

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - 성능 목표치 구체화 (동시 사용자 수, 응답 시간 임계값)
   - 배포 환경 세부사항 (로컬/스테이징/프로덕션)
   - 검증 범위 우선순위 (핵심 기능 vs 전체 기능)

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Docker Compose health check patterns for deployment validation"
   Task: "Find best practices for post-deployment validation in Node.js/React applications"
   Task: "Research automated UI testing strategies for deployment verification"
   Task: "Find performance monitoring patterns for production deployment validation"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [chosen validation approach]
   - Rationale: [why this approach fits no-modification constraint]
   - Alternatives considered: [other validation strategies evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - DeploymentStatus (timestamp, version, health, services)
   - ValidationResult (test_name, status, metrics, errors)
   - SystemMetrics (cpu, memory, response_times, concurrent_users)
   - HealthCheckResult (service, endpoint, status, latency)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - GET /health → system health status
   - GET /api/health → backend service health
   - GET /metrics → system performance metrics
   - POST /validate → trigger validation suite
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - health-check.contract.test.js
   - metrics-api.contract.test.js
   - validation-api.contract.test.js
   - Tests must fail (no validation endpoints implemented yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Deployment success → integration test scenario
   - User login flow → E2E test scenario
   - Performance under load → stress test scenario
   - Quickstart validation = complete deployment verification

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add: Docker Compose, health monitoring, deployment validation
   - Preserve existing DOT Platform context
   - Update recent changes (deployment validation feature)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (health contracts, validation model, quickstart)
- Each health endpoint → contract test task [P]
- Each validation entity → test script creation task [P]
- Each user story → E2E validation task
- Deployment pipeline tasks to enable validation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Health check tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Health endpoints before validation scripts before E2E tests
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent validation scripts)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations detected - deployment validation fits within constitutional constraints*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
