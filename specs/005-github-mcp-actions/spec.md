# Feature Specification: GitHub MCP Integration for Actions Management

**Feature Branch**: `005-github-mcp-actions`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "GitHub MCP $X  Actions $X t°"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with the DOT platform, I need to monitor and troubleshoot GitHub Actions workflows directly from my development environment, so that I can quickly identify and resolve CI/CD pipeline issues without switching between multiple tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub repository with Actions workflows, **When** I connect the GitHub integration tool, **Then** I can view the current status of all workflows
2. **Given** a failed GitHub Actions workflow, **When** I request error details, **Then** I receive comprehensive error logs and failure reasons
3. **Given** an Actions configuration issue, **When** I analyze the workflow, **Then** I receive actionable suggestions for resolution
4. **Given** a running workflow, **When** I monitor it in real-time, **Then** I see live updates of job progress and logs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GitHub API rate limits are reached?
- How does system handle workflows with very large log outputs?
- What happens when GitHub credentials expire or are revoked?
- How does system handle private repository access permissions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to GitHub repositories and authenticate with appropriate permissions
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve and display GitHub Actions workflow statuses (queued, in_progress, completed, failed)
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch and present detailed logs from workflow runs
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify common GitHub Actions errors and provide troubleshooting suggestions
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to view workflow history and compare different runs
- **FR-006**: System MUST support real-time monitoring of running workflows
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle authentication securely without exposing tokens
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to filter workflows by status, name, or date
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide direct links to GitHub Actions pages for detailed investigation
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect GitHub API rate limits and handle quota exhaustion gracefully
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which GitHub Actions events to monitor - push, pull_request, schedule, manual?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain workflow data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how long should historical data be kept?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multiple repositories simultaneously or one at a time?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow**: Represents a GitHub Actions workflow configuration with its status, triggers, and jobs
- **WorkflowRun**: An instance of a workflow execution with status, duration, logs, and outcome
- **Job**: Individual job within a workflow run with its own status and logs
- **Error**: Captured error or failure from a workflow run with context and potential solutions
- **Repository**: GitHub repository being monitored for Actions activity

## Notes
This feature specification focuses on integrating GitHub monitoring capabilities to help developers troubleshoot CI/CD pipeline issues more efficiently. The system will provide real-time insights into GitHub Actions workflows without requiring constant context switching to the GitHub web interface.
